                            Elsevier, the modern publishing business, was founded in 1880. It has evolved from a small Dutch publishing house devoted to classical scholarship into an international multimedia publishing business with over 20,000 products for educational and professional science and healthcare communities worldwide. Elsevier takes its name from the original House of Elzevir, a Dutch family publishing house founded in 1580.

Elsevier's history reflects a series of collaborations in the effort to advance science and health. These publishing collaborations with a group of scientific visionaries – ranging from Jules Verne to Stephen W. Hawking – created the foundation of scientific and medical publishing.

                            The efforts of the men and women dedicated to disseminating and using scientific and medical knowledge have been equally critical – the editors, printers, librarians, nurses, doctors, engineers, information specialists and business people at the centre of scientific and health publishing.

                            Every day, research and health professionals dedicate themselves to improving outcomes for communities, patients and society at large. The massive societal gains in life expectancy, poverty reduction and global health that we have seen in the last century have been possible in part by an exponential explosion of information, data and advancements in technology. 

As a global leader in information and analytics, we help researchers and healthcare professionals advance science and improve health outcomes for the benefit of society.
